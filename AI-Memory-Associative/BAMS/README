       AI::Memory::Associative::Bidirectional

      A Memory handler based on Neural Networks

###
# I use the Kosko Algorithm:
#
# 1. For all i and j, reset all weights (wij) and input values (ai, bi) to zero
# 2. Load A and B into memory - the binary associations to be learned
# 3. Compute the weuight matrix
# 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every association to be learned
# 5. Input values for A and B to be run on the network
# 6. Run the A->B iterations on the network
# 7. Run the B->A iterations on the network
# 8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until there are no changes in the A or B vectors
#
# This method is described in Chapter 3 of
#   "Introduction to Neural and Cognitive Modeling"
#     by Dr. Daniel S. Levine, 2000.
